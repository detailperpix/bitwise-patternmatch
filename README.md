# bitwise-patternmatch

bitwise-patternmatch is a pattern matching program that uses
the features of using a bitvector to find matching string in
a given text. 
The pattern matching algorithm has similarity
with the bitap algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitap_algorithm.

This program is created for fulfilling the assessment of coursework in Algorithms & Data Structures.

# Running the program
The program is run with the following format:
```
python -k bitpm.py text_file pattern_file
```
- text_file is file containing input string
- pattern_file is file containing pattern string

The program will output the result on _output_bitpm.txt_ within
the same directory as _bitpm.py_

# About version
Program is tested to run on Python 3.8.5
